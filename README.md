# Pizza Shop Billing System

This is a simple console-based Pizza Shop Billing System implemented in C. The program allows customers to place their pizza orders, choose beverages, and calculate the total bill based on the order type and any available discounts. The system also provides an administration section where administrators can view the billing records.<br><br>

## Features:

- Customer can order vegetarian and non-vegetarian pizzas as well as beverages.<br>
- Discounts are applied based on whether the customer has a membership card and the total bill amount.<br>
- The program provides options for both delivery and pick-up orders.<br>
- The administration section allows authorized personnel to view the billing records.<br><br><br>


## Getting Started:

- Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).<br>
- Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code files.<br>
- Compile the source code using the C compiler.<br><br>

`gcc pizza_shop_billing_system.c -o pizza_shop_billing_system
`<br><br>
- Run the compiled executable.<br><br>

`./pizza_shop_billing_system`<br><br><br>


## How to Use:

1. When the program starts, you can choose between the "Customer" and "Administration" options.<br>
2. If you select "Administration," you need to enter the correct password to access the billing records.<br>

6. After the order is complete, a bill is displayed, and customers can choose to exit or place more orders.<br><br><br>
